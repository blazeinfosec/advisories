1. Advisory information
- - - - -----------------

Title: i2p for Windows local privilege escalation
Advisory reference: BLAZE-02-2020
Product: i2p 0.7.5 to 0.9.45 for Windows
CVE reference: CVE-2020-13431
Disclosure mode: Coordinated


2. Product description
- - - - ----------------

i2p (The Invisible Internet Project) is an anonymous network, exposing a simple layer that
applications can use to anonymously and securely send messages to each other.

Frequently, I2P is compared to Tor as an anonymity tool.


3. Vulnerability details
- - - - ------------------

During the installation process, I2P Windows client offers to install itself also as a service, named I2PSvc.
It runs as SYSTEM and runs upon the start up of the operating system. While inspecting I2P for Windows, it was
noticed it installs itself in Program Files with very lax permissions, allowing any user to replace I2PSvc.exe
for a malicious executable.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have an unprivileged local account in the system.

This vulnerability has been found in the latest version 0.9.45 but affected i2p since 0.7 series of releases from
over a decade ago.

I2P installs itself in C:\Program Files\i2p.

As can be seen below, the “F” permission for BUILTIN\Users means all users within the system have full control over the directory and its subfolders:


C:\Users\lowpriv> cacls "C:\Program Files\i2p"
C:\Program Files\i2p BUILTIN\Users:F
		     NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(ID)F
		     NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(CI)(IO)(ID)F
		     NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(ID)F
		     NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(IO)(ID)F
		     BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
		     BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(IO)(ID)F
		     BUILTIN\Users:(ID)R
		     BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(ID)(special access: )
							GENERIC_READ
							GENERIC_EXECUTE
		     CREATOR OWNER:(OI)(CI)(IO)(ID)F


By replacing the service executable with a malicious one, an attacker can execute code with SYSTEM privileges.



4. Fix and recommendations
- - - - --------------------

Upgrade i2p to version v0.9.46.
