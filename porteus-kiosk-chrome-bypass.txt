1. Advisory information
- - -----------------------

Title: Porteus Kiosk security restrictions bypass
Advisory reference: BLAZE-01-2017
Product: Porteus Kiosk
Disclosure mode: Coordinated disclosure


2. Product description
- - ----------------------

Porteus Kiosk is a popular lightweight Linux designed to be used as a
kiosk solution. It implements several restrictions with the intent to
prevent malicious users to modify the configuration of the Firefox browser
and to escape the restricted browser environment and obtain access to the
underlying operating system and filesystem.


3. Vulnerability details
- - ------------------------

In order to restrict access to the browser configuration facilities,
Porteus Kiosk removed these menus from the browser interface. In addition,
it implemented a blacklist filter to prevent the user from accessing
protocols that can be abused to escape these restrictions, such as file://
and numerous chrome:// URIs.

During a security review of this kiosk solution it was found the blacklist
was not enough to prevent the user to access configuration menus of the
browser.

By typing any of these chrome URIs in Firefox:

chrome://global/content/config.xul
chrome://browser/content/openLocation.xul
chrome://global/content/filepicker.xul
chrome://mozapps/content/plugins/pluginInstallerWizard.xul
chrome://passwordmgr/content/passwordManager.xul
chrome://browser/content/preferences/preferences.xul
chrome://browser/content/preferences/advanced.xul
chrome://browser/content/preferences/applications.xul
chrome://browser/content/preferences/connection.xul
chrome://browser/content/preferences/permissions.xul
chrome://browser/content/preferences/sanitize.xul
chrome://browser/content/preferences/security.xul
chrome://mozapps/content/downloads/downloads.xul
chrome://browser/content/safeMode.xul

A user of the kiosk can access its configurations, password manager, etc.
For example, a malicious user can reconfigure the network preferences to
point to an attacker-controlled proxy and launch other attacks from there,
intercept traffic and other malicious actions.


4. Fix and recommendations
